- I have made four version of my logo:
![Four version of logo](/app/static/images/all_logos.png)
I went around asking which one people like the most
- **Top Left**
  - Top right is the original
- **Top Right**
  - Top right is the first change I made. 
  - "I like this one more since it introduces a new colour into the picture" - Simen
- **Bottom Right**
  - Bottom right is the second change I made.
  - "I like that you are surrounding the middle part with colours" - Alf Morten
- **Bottom left**
  - Bottom left is the last change I made.
  - "This one fits more with UX, since it is easier to read and isn't as confusing as the with lines" - Random Student

After all the comments I got back for my Logo, I will be using the Bottom left one:
